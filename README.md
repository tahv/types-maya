# types-maya

External type annotations for Autodesk Maya Python API.

The main goal is to provide helper for [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright)
language server to offer better autocompletion.

## Available stubs

These stubs are manually maintained and updated as needed for my projects,
which means they are currently far from complete.
